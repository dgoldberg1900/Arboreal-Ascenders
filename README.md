# Arboreal Ascenders: Tree-Climbing Robot for Wildfire Suppression

This repository contains the final report for the **Arboreal Ascenders** senior design project at Stevens Institute of Technology. Our team designed and prototyped an autonomous robot capable of climbing trees and dispensing fire suppressants to help contain wildfires.

🔧 **My Role**:  
I was responsible for the robot’s **code architecture**, **hardware setup**, and **electrical wiring**. I implemented the control logic for autonomous climbing and integrated sensors to navigate irregular tree surfaces.

🎯 **Project Goal**:  
To reduce risk to wildlife and first responders by deploying a swarm of autonomous climbing robots that can suppress wildfires from elevated positions in forest environments.
